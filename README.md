# Fox Randomizer
Fox Randomizer is an interactive web app designed for fox enthusiasts who want to celebrate their love for foxes. Users can randomly generate fox images on the home page using the [RandomFox API](https://randomfox.ca/floof/). Once a user finds a fox image they like, they can save it by creating an entry, which requires adding a suitable title and description. Users can view their saved entries at any time by clicking on the "foxes" tab, which displays all their created entries. To modify or delete an entry, users can click the corresponding pencil icon and proceed with their chosen action.
